AGENT TEST REPORT

Summary
- Unit tests: pytest agent/tests
- Integration tests: mock collector verifies `/agent/heartbeat` and `/events`
- Smoke: ./scripts/agent_smoke_test.sh (captures agent_status JSONL)

Evidence commands
- pytest agent/tests
- ./scripts/agent_smoke_test.sh
- docker exec -i eventsec-db-1 psql -U eventsec -d eventsec -c "select id,name,last_seen from agents order by id desc limit 5;"
- docker exec -i eventsec-db-1 psql -U eventsec -d eventsec -c "select event_type, details->>'hostname', created_at from events order by created_at desc limit 5;"

Residual risks
- CPU/RAM telemetry is not emitted by the agent.
- `/agents` API requires auth; UI handles it (curl without JWT will return 401).
