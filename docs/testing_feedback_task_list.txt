Field Feedback Task List (30 items)
========================================

Use this checklist to drive structured feedback during two-host testing. Mark each task with:
  [ ] Not started   [~] In progress   [x] Completed

1.  [ ] Verify admin login from Host A (browser) using new credentials.
2.  [ ] Verify analyst login from Host B (browser or curl).
3.  [ ] Confirm `/auth/login` returns HTTP 200 for both roles via curl.
4.  [ ] Verify `/me` returns profile data after each login.
5.  [ ] List alerts via API and confirm three seeded alerts exist.
6.  [ ] Create a new alert from Host A UI and check it appears on Host B UI.
7.  [ ] Delete an alert and confirm it disappears from both hosts without refresh.
8.  [ ] Run agent on Host B and confirm it enrolls (visible under Endpoints).
9.  [ ] Trigger agent network telemetry (phishing URL) and verify dashboard updates.
10. [ ] Execute an endpoint isolation command and confirm agent receives it.
11. [ ] Release the endpoint and ensure status flips back in UI.
12. [ ] Run remote reboot command and capture agent console output.
13. [ ] Submit sandbox URL analysis and verify verdict + VT/YARA data populate.
14. [ ] Upload a file to the sandbox and ensure impacted endpoints list updates.
15. [ ] Create a workplan, assign it to an alert, and change its status.
16. [ ] Add War Room notes (with and without attachments) and verify persistence.
17. [ ] Escalate an alert to another user and confirm notification in UI.
18. [ ] Test handover email flow (log output) for accuracy.
19. [ ] Create a new BIOC rule and ensure it’s editable afterwards.
20. [ ] Create a new analytics rule and confirm it appears in the list + API.
21. [ ] Manage indicators (add/update) and verify API reflects the changes.
22. [ ] Test utilities section (block/unblock URL) ensuring action log records it.
23. [ ] Run SIEM page KQL search with multiple filters; confirm results match API.
24. [ ] Use Events Explorer modal to open full JSON and verify OpenSearch data.
25. [ ] Confirm refresh buttons reuse local loaders (no forced logout).
26. [ ] Validate login page renders without top bar/side bar on mobile viewport.
27. [ ] Check sidebar auto-closes when navigating on small screens.
28. [ ] Test `/analytics/rules` and `/network/events` with invalid tokens (expect 401).
29. [ ] Inspect browser console for React Router warnings (should be clean now).
30. [ ] Record resource usage + stability over 30 minutes of dual-host activity.
31. [ ] Install the agent on a clean host, confirm enrollment + telemetry hits dashboard.

Add more rows if you need deeper coverage; just keep the numbering consistent. Capture feedback for each task in `docs/test_results_template.txt` as you execute them.
