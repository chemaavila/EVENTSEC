EventSec Documentation - Multi-Host Test Log
===========================================

Use this template every time you run an end-to-end test with two or more hosts.
Duplicate the sections below for each scenario so the team can compare runs.

1. Test Metadata
   - Date & time:
   - Tester:
   - Test identifier / ticket:
   - Backend host (IP / hostname):
   - Agent host(s) (IP / hostname):
   - Code version / git commit (if available):

2. Environment Notes
   - Docker compose status (include `docker compose ps` snapshot):
   - Agent build info (OS, build script, PyInstaller / binary hash if relevant):
   - Special configuration overrides (env vars, agent_config.json changes, etc.):

3. Scenario Overview
   - Objective:
   - Preconditions (alerts seeded, endpoints available, credentials used, etc.):
   - High-level steps:

4. Detailed Execution Log
   For each step capture command, expected result, actual result, and artifacts.
   Example entry:
   ```
   Step #: Short title
   Command / action:
   Expected:
   Actual:
   Evidence / screenshot / log path:
   Notes:
   ```

5. Metrics & Observations
   - Latency (login, alert creation, agent heartbeat):
   - Resource usage (CPU/RAM for backend & agent) if monitored:
   - OpenSearch health:
   - Any UI warnings or console errors:

6. Issues & Follow-Up
   - Issue ID / description:
   - Severity / impact:
   - Temporary workaround (if any):
   - Suggested fix or next steps:

7. Pass / Fail Summary
   - Overall verdict:
   - Reasons:

8. Attachments Checklist
   - Screenshots stored at:
   - Logs stored at:
   - Packet captures / other files:

Remember to save one completed section per scenario so we can build a historical record of multi-host testing results.
